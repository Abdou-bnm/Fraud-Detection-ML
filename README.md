## Project Overview
This project implements a **Machine Learning solution** for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, we've built a **Random Forest Classifier** that can accurately identify potentially fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives.

### Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, causing billions of dollars in losses annually. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to adapt to new fraud patterns. This project leverages machine learning to:
- Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time  
- Reduce false positives to maintain customer satisfaction  
- Provide interpretable results for fraud investigation teams

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves excellent performance metrics with Random Forest  
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies the most important factors in fraud detection  
- **Performance Metrics**: ROC curves, confusion matrices, and classification reports  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Beautiful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- **Scalable**: Easily deployable for real-world applications

## Data  

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023** from Kaggle.  

- **Dataset link**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023/data)  
- **Size**: ~550,000 transactions (~150 MB)  
- **Source**: Kaggle (uploaded by [nelgiriyewithana](https://www.kaggle.com/nelgiriyewithana))  
- **Note**: The dataset is **not included** in this repository due to size and licensing. Please download it yourself if youâ€™d like to run the full analysis.  

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains **credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023**.  
It comprises **over 550,000 records**, and the data has been **anonymized** to protect cardholder identities.  

The primary objective of the dataset is to support the **development of fraud detection algorithms and models** that can identify potentially fraudulent transactions.  

### How to Use It
1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above.  
2. Move the CSV file into the `data/` folder.  

Expected structure:
```
Fraud-Detection-ML/
â””â”€â”€ data/
    â””â”€â”€ creditcard_2023.csv   # Kaggle dataset file (not tracked in git)
```

ðŸ‘‰ For quick tests, the repo includes small `sample_*.csv` files (kept in git) so you can try out the notebooks without downloading the full dataset.  

### Demo data
For lightweight testing, a small demo dataset is already included in this repository:  

- **File**: `data/sample_small.csv`  
- **Size**: first 5,000 rows of the full dataset  

This sample is small enough to be tracked in git and lets you run the notebooks instantly, even if you donâ€™t download the full dataset from Kaggle.
